# Data 110 — Smithsonian Data-Viz Scavenger Hunt + Group Presentation

## Purpose
Build your data-viz literacy in a real-world setting. You will go to a Smithsonian museum (in groups of **2–3 students, no more**) and document **5–6 data visualizations**, covering at least **4 different chart types**. Then you’ll synthesize your findings into a **4-slide presentation** and present to the class.

---

## Group Work Rules
- Groups must be  solo **2–3 students maximum**.  
- One submission per group (but list all members).  
- Everyone must contribute to both the **report** and the **presentation**.  
- Each member must speak during the presentation.

## Assignment Parts

### Part 1: Museum Scavenger Hunt (Report)
At the museum, collect **5–6 visualizations**. For each visualization, include:
1. **Photo or sketch** (if photos are not allowed)  
2. **Chart type** (bar, line, histogram, map, scatterplot, etc.)  
3. **Main question** it answers  
4. **Data shown** (variables, units, timeframe)  
5. **Marks & channels** used (position, length, color, etc.)  
6. **Design choices** (scales, labels, legends, annotations)  
7. **Potential misleaders** (axes, colors, aspect ratio, etc.)  
8. **One suggested improvement**  

Your written analysis goes into a **Markdown report** on GitHub:
- File name: `museum-viz-report.md`  
- Include an **/images** folder for photos/sketches  
- Add a **group reflection (150–250 words)** at the end

### Part 2: Slides (5 total)
Prepare a concise 5-slide deck:

- **Slide 1 – Title & Context**  
  - Group member names  
  - Museum + exhibit visited  
  - Date of visit  

- **Slides 2–4 – Visualization Analyses**  
  Each slide should focus on **one data visualization** your group selected (3 total). For each visualization include:  
  - Photo (or sketch) of the viz  
  - **Chart type** (bar, line, histogram, map, etc.)  
  - **Main question** it answers  
  - **Design critique**: what works and what doesn’t  
  - **One suggested improvement**  

- **Slide 5 – Reflection**  
  - What surprised your group about data viz in museums?  
  - One design lesson you’ll carry forward into your own projects

### Part 3: Presentation
- **Format:** In-class, live presentation (5 minutes per group)  
- **Time limit:** 5 minutes maximum  
- **Speaking rule:** Each member must present at least one slide  
- Focus on clarity, visuals, and main takeaways (not text-heavy slides)
