# Week 3: Line and Scatter Plots — Recap and Assignment

## In-Class Recap
This week we explored two essential plotting techniques in Matplotlib:  

- **Line Plots (`plt.plot`)**  
  Line plots are best for showing **continuous data** — for example, mathematical functions or trends over time.  
  In class, we used `np.linspace` to generate smooth x-values and then plotted functions like quadratics, exponentials, and trigonometric curves. We also learned how to make these plots clearer by adding titles, axis labels, legends, and by adjusting line colors and styles.  

- **Scatter Plots (`plt.scatter`)**  
  Scatter plots are best for showing **individual data points** — for example, pairs of measurements or random samples.  
  We practiced creating random data with `np.random.rand()` and plotting relationships between x and y. We also customized marker size, color, shape, and transparency, and saw how scatter can be combined with line plots to highlight both the data and the underlying function.  

Together, these tools give you flexibility:  
- Use **line plots** to show smooth curves and continuous relationships.  
- Use **scatter plots** to display raw data, variability, or comparisons between two variables.  

## Assignment
The **Week 3 Assignment** builds directly on these skills. You will:  
- Create and style new line and scatter plots.  
- Experiment with styles (`plt.style.use(...)`) to see how appearance changes interpretation.  
- Combine multiple techniques (labels, legends, scaling, scatter + line together).  
- Compare results across different styles and reflect on what makes a visualization effective.  

Use the assignment to **solidify your plotting skills** before moving on to more advanced visualization methods.
